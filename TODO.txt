TASKS TODO:

[ ] Make quartile velocity colors based on velocity thresholds in data file
[ ] Improve velocity interpolation
[ ] Refine Update to keep Particles from jumping around when they get reset; possibly store their initial point and reset when they leave bounds
[ ] Figure out how to remove GameObject from its FixedJoint when it is destroyed
[ ] Implement rate of aggregation; probability for particles to stick together
[ ] Find way to smooth surface of geometry
[*] Fix exceptions caused by Particles going out of bounds
[*] Create separate class for Particle objects; this will give better control over position, collision, destruction, etc
[X] In new Particle class, set up Start function
[*] In new Particle class, set up OnCollision functions
[*] In new Particle class, set up FixedUpdate functions
