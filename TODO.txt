TASKS TODO:

[ ] Get data on all particles' aggregations, speeds, etc.
[ ] Color open space based on -x velocity by spawning a translucent red no-clip cube
[ ] Improve velocity interpolation
[ ] Refine Update to keep Particles from jumping around when they get reset; possibly store their initial point and reset when they leave bounds
[ ] Write README
[ ] Find way to smooth surface of geometry
[*] Fix exceptions caused by Particles going out of bounds
[*] Create separate class for Particle objects; this will give better control over position, collision, destruction, etc
[X] In new Particle class, set up Start function UNNEEDED 
[*] In new Particle class, set up OnCollision functions
[*] In new Particle class, set up FixedUpdate functions
[*] Figure out how to remove GameObject from its FixedJoint when it is destroyed
[*] Make quartile velocity colors based on velocity thresholds in data file
[*] Implement rate of aggregation; probability for particles to stick together
[*] Loop program when all particles destroyed
