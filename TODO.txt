TASKS TODO:

[*] Fix exceptions caused by Particles going out of bounds
[ ] Create separate class for Particle objects; this will give better control over position, collision, destruction, etc
[ ] In new Particle class, set up Start function
[ ] In new Particle class, set up OnCollision functions
[ ] In new Particle class, set up Update functions
[ ] Refine Update to keep Particles from jumping around when they get reset; possibly store their initial point and reset when they leave bounds
[ ] Rate of aggregation; probability for particles to stick together
[ ] Smooth surface of geometry
[ ] Improve velocity interpolation
