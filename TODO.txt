TASKS TODO:

[ ] Get data on all particles' aggregation, speed, location, collision time.
[ ] Write analytics data to a file
[ ] Improve velocity interpolation
[ ] Refine Update to keep Particles from jumping around when they get reset; possibly store their initial point and reset when they leave bounds
[ ] Write README
[ ] Find way to smooth surface of geometry

TASKS DONE:
[*] Fix exceptions caused by Particles going out of bounds
[*] Create separate class for Particle objects; this will give better control over position, collision, destruction, etc
[*] In new Particle class, set up OnCollision functions
[*] In new Particle class, set up FixedUpdate functions
[*] Figure out how to remove GameObject from its FixedJoint when it is destroyed
[*] Make quartile velocity colors based on velocity thresholds in data file
[*] Implement rate of aggregation; probability for particles to stick together
[*] Loop program when all particles destroyed
[*] Variable aggregation rates per iteration
[*] Implement survival time: track how long a particle goes before it aggregates
[*] Color open space based on -x velocity by spawning a translucent red no-clip cube
