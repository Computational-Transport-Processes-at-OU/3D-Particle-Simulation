TASKS TODO:

	velocity is. 
[ ] Improve velocity interpolation
[ ] Refine Update to keep Particles from jumping around when they get reset; possibly store their initial point and reset when they leave bounds
[ ] Write README
[ ] Find way to smooth surface of geometry

TASKS DONE:
[*] Fix exceptions caused by Particles going out of bounds
[*] Create separate class for Particle objects; this will give better control over position, collision, destruction, etc
[*] In new Particle class, set up OnCollision functions
[*] In new Particle class, set up FixedUpdate functions
[*] Figure out how to remove GameObject from its FixedJoint when it is destroyed
[*] Make quartile velocity colors based on velocity thresholds in data file
[*] Implement rate of aggregation; probability for particles to stick together
[*] Loop program when all particles destroyed
[*] Variable aggregation rates per iteration
[*] Implement survival time: track how long a particle goes before it aggregates
[*] Color open space based on -x velocity by spawning a translucent red no-clip cube
[*] Check if X,Y,Z are ordered correctly
[*] Store initial position, calculate survival distance
[*] Find out why some survival times stay at 0.02 sec. Some particles' times are not being incremented
[*] Write analytics data to a file
[*] Track nunber of particles that are not aggregated
[*] Distances are not lining up. Why? I think updating survival distance incorrectly.
[*] Do not subtract deleted particles from non-aggregated count
[*] Make particles not spawn in the same position. Option to set drag? Test if particles will collide with no other forces.
[*] Find out why red is only coloring one face of cube. Maybe start by placing particles where v_x < 0 to make sure we know where negative
